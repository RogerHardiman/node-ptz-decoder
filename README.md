# Installation
Run the following command form the command line to install the NPM package
```
npm install pelcod-decoder
```

# Command Line Test Program
The command line test program is executed as
```
node read_serial_port.js
```
This opens a serial port, waits for bytes and then decodes their meaning.
The following flags customise the usage
 * -h    help
 * -l    list available serial port
 * -v    verbose. Show raw bytes read read from serial port
 * -V    version
 * --baud value
 * --parity value (values are none,even,odd)



# Baud Rates
Pelco D telemery is always 7 bytes long and always starts with 0xFF and ends with a checksum. On a Pelco KBD300A Pelco D runs at 2400 baud 8-N-1 with 4800 and 9600 also common on other installations.

Pelco P telemetry is always 8 bytes long and starts with 0xA0 and ends with 0xAF and a checksum. On a Pelco KBD300A Pelco P runs at 4800 baud 8-N-1 with 2400 and 9600 also common on other installations.
The Pelco CM9760-KBD outputs Pelco P in Direct Mode with Even parity.

Bosch (Philips) is always 9600 baud 8-N-1

Forward Vision is always 9600 baud ODD Parity 8-O-1

The Vicon system tested ran at 9600 baud although the official speed is believed to be 4800 baud

# Stream Sources
The module processes data from a NodeJS Buffer object. A small example program, read_from_serial.js, will read from a Serial Port / COM Port (using node-serial) and pass data into the CCTV PTZ telemetry decoder.
